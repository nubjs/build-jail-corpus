  # the unique ROOT name above does not separate them. Dropping `pm/side-effects-v1` was the fix for
  # that — and it is INSUFFICIENT, proven on the Windows driver, which carries both mitigations and
  # replayed anyway: three runs of the same binary and package gave rc=1 with a real refusal once,
  # then rc=0 twice, and diffing the install logs showed the later runs printed only
  # `materialized …` / `installed 1 package in 2.4s` where the first had downloaded 84 packages and
  # run the script. **The lifecycle script never executed.** The surviving replay source is the
  # GLOBAL VIRTUAL STORE — a package already materialized there is relinked, not reinstalled, so its
  # scripts do not run again.
  #
  # ⛔ AND EVERY PRECONDITION STAYED GREEN THROUGHOUT — override engaged, jail stated, unique name,
  # fixture outside temp. That is what makes this the most dangerous failure shape in the harness:
  # it does not break, it silently measures nothing.
  #
  # ⛔⛔ A PER-ARM `NUB_CACHE_DIR` DOES **NOT** CLOSE THIS, AND AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS FILE
  # CLAIMED IT DID. That is worse than no fix, because it looks like protection. `NUB_CACHE_DIR`
  # governs the RESOLVER PRIMER CACHE only — `pm_engine/mod.rs` says so where it maps
  # `config_env("CACHE_DIR")`, and the store comes from a DIFFERENT function,
  # `aube_store::dirs::cache_dir()` joined with the embedder's `virtual_store_subdir`
  # (`vite_compat.rs:248`). MEASURED on Windows: with a fresh cache dir per arm, the arm's cache
  # ended the run with ZERO files while the old store still served the package.
  #
  # So evict the package from the STORE instead. The positive control that settles it: before
  # eviction the install log holds only `materialized …` (1.2s); after eviction it holds the
  # package's OWN script output — both binary downloads, the extractions, `Success!` (5.8s). The
  # script's stdout appears only in the evicted arm.
  #
  # ⛔ TARGETED, NOT `rm -rf` ON THE WHOLE STORE. The store is MACHINE-GLOBAL and a sibling agent
  # may be measuring on the same box; wiping it would silently corrupt their run. Match the
  # package's own entries only.
  #
  # Cost: each arm re-materializes this package from scratch. That is the price of independent arms.

# ── 3b. DIAGNOSE — re-run the SAME failing grant JAILED, under strace, and name the refusal. ───
#
# ⛔ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE OBSERVING AN UNJAILED RUN STRUCTURALLY CANNOT PREDICT EVERY REFUSAL.
# Step 1 enumerates what the script TOUCHED; it cannot enumerate what confinement will later REFUSE
# on an axis the tracer does not cover, and it cannot see a path the script only reaches once some
# earlier read succeeds. So an under-prediction is expected, and "the synthesized grant did not
# verify" is worth nothing on its own — the ladder that follows says a WIDER grant worked, never
# WHICH capability was missing.
#
# Every Linux `write:"disk"` package resolved so far was closed by exactly this arm, run BY HAND:
# `dotnet-2.0.0@1.4.4`, `@nuxt/components@2.1.0`, `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm`, `codeceptjs`,
# `postman-code-generators`, `react-native-purchases` — all six turned out to be ONE refused read
# (`/proc/self/stat`, via yarn v1's `initPeakMemoryCounter` -> `process.memoryUsage()` -> libuv's
# `uv_resident_set_memory`). Doing it by hand six times is what this automates.
#
# ⛔ THE GREP IS `= -1 EACCES`, NOT `EACCES`. A bare grep matches the `AT_EACCESS` FLAG NAME in
# every `faccessat2(...)` line — measured, that read 26/13/1 where the truth was 11/0/0.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE OUTPUT IS A LEAD AND THE "LAST REFUSAL" LINE HAS ALREADY BEEN WRONG ONCE — READ THIS
# BEFORE ACTING ON IT. On `@opencode-ai/cli@0.0.0-next-16573` the last refusal before `tgkill(SIGABRT)`
# really was `/proc/self/cgroup`, confirmed by strace. It was a TRAILING RED HERRING: a
# single-variable arm granting `/proc/self/cgroup` ALONE still aborts, while granting
# `/proc/self/maps` alone exits 0 (3/3 runs), and a negative control granting cgroup +
# mmap_min_addr + version_signature together still aborts — so `maps` is necessary and cgroup is
# merely the last thing tried before death.
#
# ⇒ TREAT THE LIST AS A CANDIDATE SET AND SETTLE IT WITH A SINGLE-VARIABLE ARM PER PATH. Grant one,
# re-run, repeat; then a negative control granting all the OTHERS to prove the survivor is
# necessary and not merely sufficient. The full refusal census above is the more honest output of
# the two, which is why it prints first and unabridged.
